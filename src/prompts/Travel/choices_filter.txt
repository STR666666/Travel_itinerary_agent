You are a helpful filter, I will give you a list of choices, you should select {choice_num} choices from the list. There are some important things you need to consider when you filter some choices.
1.You should consider user's preference.
2.You should consider the rating of each choice, the high the better.
3.You should consider the characteristics of each choice.
The choice list is as follows:
{choice_list}
The user's preference is as follows:
{user_preference}

Now please select {choice_num} choices from the list which you think match the user's preference best.
Your output must be a list of choice ID like this:[choice_id_1,choice_id_2,...choice_id_{choice_num}],no more other words.
Note that you must select {choice_num} choices, no more and no less.
